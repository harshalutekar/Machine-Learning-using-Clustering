# Machine-Learning-using-Clustering
The objective of the project is to perform machine learning using clustering to split mall customers into cluster groups using k-means, gaussian mixture and support vector machine(failed). The clustering can be done on multiple factors from the dataset like age, Gender, annual income and spending score.
Using Python, we explored the data initially and then performed the machine learning clustering algorithms. We used multiple libraries to support the machine learning process and explore the data visually for a better understanding.
The libraries used in Python are:
  1. NumPy
  2. Pandas
  3. Sci-kit learn
  4. Sklearn
  5. Matplotlib
  6. Seaborn
